# Fitness 365

This is a website for Fitness 365, a gym based in the heart of Limerick City, Ireland. Fitness 365 is a fully equipped gym that also runs group classes daily aswell as private one to one training sessions. The website is to inform you about the new gym and to provide as much information as possible about what Fitness 365 offers all the while being easy to navigate.

* Just to mention, the membership tab, when clicked brings you to the section of the homepage that has the memembership information, hence why i did   not create wireframe for it.

### Color Scheme
 The color scheme for the website was kept simple with black, grey and white which allows for high contrast between the text and background color.

### Fonts
The fonts that I used for the site were:
- Allerta Stencil was used for Logo.
- Athiti was used for the body.

## Features:


### Navigation Bar
The navigarion bar sits at the very top of each page, with the logo displayed at the left hand side, and the links to each page displayed at the left.
When on a mobile or tablet the the links change to a burger menbu that when click shows all page links. I went with black background and white text to make the Nav bar stand out and be visible. The page you are currently on displays a white line underneath.
