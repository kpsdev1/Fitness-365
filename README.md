# Fitness 365

This is a website for Fitness 365, a gym based in the heart of Limerick City, Ireland. Fitness 365 is a fully equipped gym that also runs group classes daily aswell as private one to one training sessions. The website is to inform you about the new gym and to provide as much information as possible about what Fitness 365 offers all the while being easy to navigate.

 #### Contact Page

* Just to mention, the membership tab, when clicked brings you to the section of the homepage that has the membership information, hence why i did   not create wireframe for it.

### Color Scheme
 The color scheme for the website was kept simple with black, grey and white which allows for high contrast between the text and background color.

### Fonts
The fonts that I used for the site were:
- Allerta Stencil was used for Logo.
- Athiti was used for the body.

## Features:


### Navigation Bar
- The navigarion bar sits at the very top of each page, with the logo displayed at the left hand side, and the links to each page displayed at the left.
- When on a mobile or tablet the the links change to a burger menu that when click shows all page links. 
- The colors used were a black background and white text to make the Nav bar stand out and be clearly visible. 
- The page you are currently on displays a white line underneath.

### Text Box area
- It is a transparent rectangular box with a white border and text in the middle.
- It is one of the things that catches the users eye at first glance when they reach the page and it gives a little synopsis about the gym.
- The box floats into the hero about 50px on destop and 30px on smaller devices.

### Membership and opening hours
- We made a rectangle that stretches 80% of the page and is centered.
- The background color is white and the text is black for contrast.
- There is a black side border at each side to make it stand out and make it more visually appealing.
- Here you can find the membership prices on the left hand side and the opening hours on the right.
- The membership and opening hours section can be accessed from any page by clicking on the membership tab on the navigation bar.

### Footer
- The footer is found at the bottom of each page and responsive for tablet and mobile too.
- It displays 4 icons for the biggest scoial media platfoms today, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram.
- When any of the icons are clicked the social media site opens on a seperate Tab, this way the user still has the Fitness 365 website open so they can easily navigate back to it.

### Gallery
- This page shows images of what the gym looks like, so the user can get a feel for what the gym has to offer and how it is layed out.
- The gallery is one of the main pages people will check out to see what the gym looks like inside so we tried to display each section with equipment clearly.
- On destops and laptops, images are 3 abreast, on device under 1280px they are 2 and on devices less thean 764px it is one image centered.
