### Site Wireframes

#### Gallery Page

 #### Contact Page
![This is a wireframe of the homepage](readme-docs/Wireframes/contact-wireframe.png)

* Just to mention, the membership tab, when clicked brings you to the section of the homepage that has the membership information, hence why I did   not create wireframe for it.

### Color Scheme
 The color scheme for the website was kept simple with black, grey and white which allows for high contrast between the text and background color.

### Typography
The fonts that were used for this website were:
- Allerta Stencil was used for Logo.
- Athiti was used for the body.
- - -

## Features:


### Navigation Bar
- The navigarion bar sits at the very top of each page, with the logo displayed at the left hand side, and the links to each page displayed at the right.
- When on a mobile or tablet the the links change to a burger menu that when click shows all page links. 
- The colors used were, a black background and white text to make the Nav bar stand out and be clearly visible. 
- The page you are currently on displays a white line underneath and also when you hover the mouse over another page a white line will also appear underneath.

### Text Box area
- It is a transparent rectangular box with a white border and text in the middle.
- It is one of the things that catches the users eye at first glance when they reach the page and it gives a little synopsis about the gym.
- The box floats into the hero image about 50px on destop and 30px on smaller devices.

- - -

### Membership and opening hours
- We made a rectangle that stretches 80% of the page and is centered.
- The background color is white and the text is black for contrast.
- There is a black side border at each side to make it stand out and make it more visually appealing.
- Here you can find the membership prices on the left hand side and the opening hours on the right.
- The membership and opening hours section can be accessed from any page by clicking on the membership tab on the navigation bar.

### Footer
- The footer is found at the bottom of each page and responsive for tablet and mobile too.
- It displays 4 icons for the biggest scoial media platfoms today, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram.
- When any of the icons are clicked the social media site opens on a seperate tab, this way the user still has the Fitness 365 website open so they can easily navigate back to it.  

![Footer which is at the bottom of every page.](readme-docs/images/footer.png)

### Gallery
- This page shows images of what the gym looks like, so the user can get a feel for what the gym has to offer and how it is layed out.
- The gallery is one of the main pages people will check out, to see what the gym looks like inside so we tried to display each section with equipment clearly.
- On destops and laptops, images are 3 abreast, on device under 1280px they are 2 and on devices less thean 764px it is one image centered.

 ### Contact Us page
- On the contact us page we have a form that a user can use to contact the gym with any query they have.
- The form takes the input for name, email, phone number and also the message that they want to submit.
- When submitted correctly the user will see a message that their from has been submitted correctly and that they can click on a link to retun to the home page.
- Below the form you will find the gym location with on an embedded google maps, the user can also view the map on a seperate page by click view larger map, which will take them to google maps, where they can get directions to the gym if needs be.

## Future Features:
In the future I would like to add a **Join now** button under the membership section that when clicked will take the user to a secure payment page that allows the to purchse membership, This would need to be implemented through a secure third party payment site like paypal.
I would also like to add a video to the gallery page that gives a virtual tour of the gym so that users can get get a better view of the gym and how it is layed out.

## Technologies Used:
The technologies that were used to create the site were:
- HTML.
- CSS.
- JavaScript which was just used for the Navigation bar.
- Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes.
- Adobe Photoshop was used to resize some of the images.
- - -

## Testing:
To make sure the site was fully responsive and compatible with different browsers and device, I tested the site on Multiple devices as well as different browsers. I also ran my code through validators to makes sure there was no code or structural errors.

### Devices the site was tested on
Below is a list of devices which I tested the site on and it was compatible with all:
- IPhone 11.
- Samsung S8.
- Sansung A52.
- Ipad 7.
- Amazon Fire.
- Dell Inspiron.
- Dell S2722DC monitor.
- IPhone 7.
  
### Web browsers the site was tested on  
Below is a list of web browsers on which the site was tested and again it was compatible with all:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Firefox
- Lambdatest realtime browser testing was used to test on the following:
    * Safari
    * Brave 
    * Opera

### Validator testing 
**HTML** 
- Each HTML page was tested for any sytax errors by running the code through the W3C validator which can be found [here](https://validator.w3.org/).
- The result was that there were no errors found for each page.  

![HTML Validator testing image of each of the sites page](readme-docs/images/html-validator.png)
  
**CSS**
- The CSS file was tested for any errors by running the code through the W3C Jiqsaw validator which can be found [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- The result also returned that there was no errors.  

![CSS Validator testing image](readme-docs/images/css-validator.png)

### Lighthouse
- I used Lighthouse in Chrome Dev tools to generate a report thats tests the sites Performance, Accessibility, Best practices and SEO.

## Bugs
- When I first put the Gallery page through the W3C validator, it was giving an error stating that I was using a section tag without having a heading tag inside it for the gallery images. To rectify this I changed the section tag to a div tag and when put through the validator it showed no errors or warnings.
- When testing the site on an IPhone 7 the text box area on the home page had the text ontop of the bottom line of the box, even though when I tested with Chrome dev tools and selected **IPhone 6/7/8** the text box area had space below the text and the bottom of the box. To fix this I increased the width of the text box by 2% on small devices and it solved the overflowing issue

## Deployment:
The site is deployed using github pages. The following steps were used to deploy the site to Github pages:
- In github on the sites repositiory, click on the **Settings** button.
- On lefthand side menu. under **code and automation section** select **Pages**.
- Under **Branch** section, change the dropdown that says **none** to **main**.
- Then click **Save** and refresh the page, please note that it can take a few minutes for the site to be live.

- Colt Steele's Web Developer bootcamp course on Udemy really helped me to understand how to use flexbox, This course is great resource for anyone interest in full stack developement and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
- w3Schools was great for help to me when I was trying to remember certain syntax or figure out how to do something. Their Sandboxes for HTML and CSS are brilliant as you can play around with snippets of code and also tailor them to your needs.
- Code institiutes love running project was invaluable as it thought me how to go about completing a project from start to finish and gave me some ideas for this site, it also allowed me to use code I had written for this project and tailor it for certain needs, like the footer which I changed around and adapted to use flexbox for the layout instead.
